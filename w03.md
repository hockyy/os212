# Top 10 List of Week 03

Hello, this is my top 10 list of Week 03! This week we're going to learn about File System!

## 1. [Files & File Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #20 (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM)

For an introduction, take a look at this **animated** video explaining the basic of file system üìÅ. Computers store data in terms of files. They are stored in the memory in blocks, if a file is large enough it will be separated into several blocks. This video is really interesting as it gives you a **good insight on where to start about file system** üêß whether its UNIX, Linux or Windows!

## 2. [6 Default Windows Files and Folders You Should Never Touch (Article)](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/default-windows-files-folders/)

Have you ever heard someone **jokingly asking you to delete** `C:\System32`? Windows' file system is in fact be quite different than a Linux's. The article briefly explain some of the **important windows' file**, that you must not delete üò≥. This link is so interesting because we all know not all "Orang awam" uses a random linux distribution. With this, we can also be familiarized with other Operating System's behavior.

## 3. [Unix Permissions Calculator (Interactive + Article)](http://permissions-calculator.org/)

File permissions in Linux and Unix is quite unique (no puns intended). You might ask: [File Permissions in Linux/Unix: How to Read/Write & Change?](https://www.guru99.com/file-permissions.html) This article will help you to understand how file permissions work in Linux, plus the **permissions calculator for newbies** that aren't good at counting and approximating what permission you should put on a file üëçüèªüëçüèª.

## 4. [Explanation to DO NOT PLAY THIS AUDIO TWICE.ogg (Reddit Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ksmrqn/explanation_to_do_not_play_this_audio_twiceogg/)

Reminder: This number 4 link is from **reddit.com**. For some ISP **(Internet service provider)** in Indonesia, you won't be able to access it. But it's really worth it!! Go access it from the `1.1.1.1` DNS or use any free VPN! or open the [Google webcached version instead](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0AvWROJKhO0J:https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ksmrqn/explanation_to_do_not_play_this_audio_twiceogg/+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=id).

Discord is one of my favorite chatting space. You can share lots and lots of medias there üì∑. There are some special stuffs on how the discord media player works. This allows some funny bugs, like once there is a **video hammer spinning for 40 years**, while the size is only **6MB**, and the most interesting one for me is the audio that will sound different when you play it twice! Some geekies tried to change the metadata on the sound files that makes it stream from two different blocks each time it plays! It's really cool as the article will also explain to you some basic file system.

## 5. [Explain Shell (Interactive)](https://explainshell.com/)

This week we got a lot of bash and shell commands to understand, from the `~/.bash_aliases`, the weird `chktoken` bash command, the "4 mantra git" `ggg`. This website **will breakdown all the bash commands**, interactively ‚ÄîYou just need to insert the command to the search bar‚Äî Including the flags, so you may understand what mysterious code our Teacher and his Teaching assistants are writing üíª. It's really interesting because it's interactive ü§£.

## 6. [Linux File System/Structure Explained! (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw)

First time using Ubuntu, I was confused üòµ. Where is my Drive C:? Where are the program files located?Everything is a file, Linux distributions have some specified directory. In fact, every operating system has its own file structuring. This video will explain to you what is **inside every well seen folder and files in a Linux Distribution,** get rid of your confusions and start exploring üèπ! This is so good as his explanation are short and compact, but **it's really meaningful**.

## 7. [Explaining File Systems: NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, ext4 & More (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws)

Ever wondering on what should you format your USB Stick or why can't you mount a certain file system on an OS? Every operating system can **mount a certain type of File systems,** and there are a lot of file systems available out there. This video will give you an explanation on some of the mosts popular file system used by **Windows, any Linux,** and **macOS** üëçüèªüëçüèª. How each file systems stores file in a different way, the subdirectories, maximum file size, and a lot of different metadata behavior. It's really cool! You should check it out! If you have time, you should also check the `https://en.wiki*edia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems` ! It contains a good table of file systems. I'm censoring it in case somehow the **Top 10 parser** will grep all wikipedia link and give a warning to any students that have it. HAHAHHA! It contains some good table you should check out as well!

## 8. [Chinese Magical Hard-Drive (Blog Posts + Explanation Video)](https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/198-chinese-magical-hard-drive/)

[This is the explanation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-D6tYBX8vE) **‚ÄîNo racism involved hehe <strike>well maybe a bit</strike>‚Äî** It's a public secret that **some cheap** chinese products are just some bad rip-offs of good brands with some bad spells involved in it. Well I admit that they really do have some good amount of researches on how to fake or cover something ü§£. In the blog and video we can see some people bought Terabytes of MicroSD and Hard-Drive for a reallllllyy cheap price. Turns out, the capacity shown is not true. This is caused by the **forged metadata of FAT32 or exFAT, even worse the hardware metadata is also forged**! The video and post is interesting because we all can see that even well known file systems got some flaws in it. Well not just that.. generally, external drives hardware actually got another second chip (microcontroller) that stores some extra metadatas that is forged by the bad people in general. What a scam world we live in üôÑ.

## 9. [Hak5 - Build Secure Online Storage - SSHFS, File Systems, Fuse and Userland, Hak5 1111 (Podcasts)](https://youtu.be/9TnlteaptoY?t=786)

**File system can actually be build!** This **FUSE** is a software interface that lets users **build their own File Systems!** It's interesting because I just want to let you know you **don't have to be focus while studying**. So lets say you're up to some evening snacks or lunch üç¥, and you're bored. Just hear this podcast! The female presenter doesn't really know anything, you'll follow her learning Filesystems with the male presenter! It's a good podcast to hear, also they explained [SSHFS](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs), a filesystem client to mount and interact with directories and files **located on a remote server or workstation over a normal ssh connection**. Sounds and looks really cool üòéüòé to use! 

## 10. [The Top 73 Fuse Open Source Projects (List)](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/fuse)

The name is quite self-explanatory. Here you can see some **crazy filesystems** that developers made. Starting from [Distribyted](https://github.com/distribyted/distribyted), a **torrent** client with on-demand file downloading as a filesystem to [exfat](https://github.com/relan/exfat) a **full-featured exFAT file system implementation** for Unix-like systems, that lets you mount one of the most used file systems in windows, or just simply USB Drives üìÇ. This is so interesting as you can imagine a whole limitless world of possibility of filesystems!!

That's all Week 3 from me. I'll start doing Week 4 as soon as possible!

Peace out!
