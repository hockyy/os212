# Top 10 List of Week 02

Hello, this is my top 10 list of Week 02!

## 1. [Public Key Cryptography: RSA Encryption Algorithm (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8)

This is a **MUST WATCH** video! Mathematics never seem to stop impressing me. This video explain the RSA Encryption algorithm which was founded in the **1970s**, (still about 50 years old from now, so young üò≤) RSA uses the fact that computers are good at multiplying, but bad at prime factorizing a number. With the fact, Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman develops an encrypting system which is widely used. Until now.

## 2. [GPG Tutorial (Interactive + Documentations)](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/gpg-tutorial)

GPG stands for **GNU Privacy Guard**, it's a CLI app used to encrypt, decrypt and maintain your PGP key. The interactive module is [here](https://www.igolder.com/PGP/). Both of the links contain basic function on GPG, pretty straightforward. You can also try to encrypt and decrypt a message with the module üîë. So fun!

## 3. [The International Obfuscated C Code Contest (Stuffs)](http://www.ioccc.org/index.html)

Obfucated Code or [Code Golf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqZgoNRERY8) is a programming art category, the goal is to code as short and as compact as possible, resulting in amazing codes. One of the cooles obfucated C code i've seen is the `donut.c` I posted in the forum üç©. Besides of that, there are a lot more cool things!! [IOCCC Winner Source Code Github Repository](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner) Here are the blessings! ü§£ C is an amazing programming language because it has some weird shortenage optimization you can do to make your C code as short as possible. [Creating music in one line of C code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9KLnN0GczI), [IOCCC 2020 endoh3 -- Most head-turning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxcnXhvJlo), [Best use of python - IOCCC 2018 endoh2.c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ak1DC1uBuc) are the examplesss!!!

## 4. [theZoo (Github Repository)](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo)

It contains some malware sample (974.45MB Repo size) you can checkout and even run on your computer! Alternatively, [**MalwareDatabase**](https://github.com/Endermanch/MalwareDatabase) also got some cool resources! I will definitely try to run WannaCryptor ‚ò£ (The famous ransomware) if I have a free time ü¶†.

## 5.  [But how does bitcoin actually work? (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)

Do you know that SHA (Secure Hashing Algorithm) is related to bitcoin mining? Yeah, neither do I. The creator of the Bitcoin protocol, **Satoshi Nakomoto**, chose to use the **SHA-256 hash function** as the basis for Bitcoin mining. Computerphile is the best computer science channel out there! I love their channel. Also check [SHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY), a video by them that is closely related to the bitcoin one üí∞. For you math nerds, you **MUST** check this video from 3B1B as well! [How secure is 256 bit security?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY). More about bitcoins, it's really an interesting topic which relates so much with encryption, protection, and security. Imagine a large system built by thousands of computers in a network. Bitcoin uses the system of [blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4), a public and peer to peer verification method about keeping data and information in a figure of chains using hashes.

## 6. [SSH Tunneling Explained (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtuAdk4MwWw)

I recently tried to use *kawung* and *badak*, the command `scp` and `rsync`. SSH Tunneling is a way to access a blocked from outside server but you know there is a way to connect from a secure shell, somehow **TO** that server. The video briefly explains SSH Tunneling and give you some hind insights about how it works and how to do it. For port references, you can read it [here](https://www.meridianoutpost.com/resources/articles/well-known-tcpip-ports.php). üéØ

## 7. [corkami/collisions (Github Repository)](https://github.com/corkami/collisions)

Don't play with fire, don't rely on MD5. MD5 is a widely used hash function. But, it suffers from some bad. By bad I mean **REAL BAD** vulnerabilities. The repo collects some existing hashing attacks, and some instant collisions script generator of any JPG, PNG, PDF, MP4, PE... - and also explore in detail common file formats to determine how they can be exploited with present or with future attacks ü¶üüëæ.

## 8. [How the US Government took control of the Internet -  The Hacker Crackdown (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFwTabn9_S0)

The Hacker Crackdown is an 18-month long collaborative effort of the **United States Secret Service** and broken-up AT&T to **take control of the Internet** in the early 1990s. Hackers were people who believed access to the Internet and computer technology should be as free and open as possible. In this video you will be explained the story about the **"war"** happening between the government and hacker! It's so good because we can see not only how computer evolutes over the year, but also **security and protection of Operating System develops!** There's also an E-Magazine [Phrack](http://phrack.org/issues/1/1.html) that is written for and from Hackers ‚å®.

## 9. [How Do Linux File Permissions Work? (Article)](https://www.howtogeek.com/67987/htg-explains-how-do-linux-file-permissions-work/)

Ever make a `script.sh` file and when you tried to `./script.sh` it but you got a permission denied message? or have you tried to ssh a remote shell but you got an unsafe permission? `chown` Will change **who** owns the file and what group it belongs, while `chmod` changes **how** the owners and groups can access the file (or if they can access it at all). The article will explain to you briefly how file permission in Linux works üîë.

## 10. [Everything You Need To Know About Edward Snowden (Video + Movie üòÜ)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vkEx5fQnc)

Edward Snowden used to work in the **NSA** (National Security Agency) and has been dubbed as a whistle-blower, a snitch. He leaks **NSA**'s program about spying on user's data through companies' servers. Several countries had controversies about this. To know more, you can watch an Indonesian storytell about the movie [Snowden (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WSxhyWsylg) that was based on his story. You should also know the story about [Julian Assange, WikiLeaks' Founder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6FoFPhjo). Also, this is a Vox journal video on [How America fails its whistleblowers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuiDuoRJkOY) üì∞üì∞.

That's all Week 2 from me. I'll start doing Week 3 as soon as possible!

Peace out!
